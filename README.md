# Data Mining Politechnika Warszawska (Warsaw University of Technology)

During this class, we implemented some machine learning algorithms using the C++ programming language. Throughout the course, we were encouraged to work on real-world projects and apply what we learned to solve practical problems. This hands-on approach helped us gain a deeper understanding of machine learning concepts and a good understanding of how to construct problem-solving skills by constructing the algorithm. Overall, this class provided a solid foundation in machine learning and some algorithms that will be invaluable in my future career as a machine learning engineer.Â
